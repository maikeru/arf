A Ruby on Rails practice project based on the github [play-by-play](https://peepcode.com/products/play-by-play-tenderlove-ruby-on-rails) with Aaron Patterson.

First, get Github events for a specific user (I may just re-use Aaron's code for this or may try reproducing it from scratch for practice).
Next build the web-application part. We want to be able to:
* Log in
* Specify a user to track
* Display stats about the user
* Set goals relating to the stats

Goal Setting
------------
The idea is to be able to set goals for your Github account.
e.g. 
* Achieve a certain number of commits by a specific date
* Set a number of commits per week

Need to be able to :
* list goals
* see in progress, completed and missed goals
* receive reminder emails when near to goal date if haven't already met the goal (so email if no commits when the goal is one commit per week)
